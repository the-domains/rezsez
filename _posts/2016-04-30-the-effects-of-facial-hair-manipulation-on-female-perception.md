Interesting study!

<article style=""><h1>The effects of facial hair manipulation on female perceptions of attractiveness, masculinity, and dominance in male faces</h1><p>The aim of this study was to examine the effects of systematic alterations in male facial hair on female perceptions. A within-subjects design employed one condition (facial hair) incorporating five levels (clean-shaven, light stubble, heavy stubble, light beard and full beard). All levels were applied to three different facial designs, constructed using FACES software.</p><img src="http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0191886908X0011X-cov150h.gif" /></article>

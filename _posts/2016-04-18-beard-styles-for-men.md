# Beard Styles for Men

Which One Allows You To Dominate? 

****

****

Find your beard. It took me a long time to find my beard...

****

Those of us who choose to wear a beard come from all different walks of life, but one thing is clear,...we are all unapologetically male. 

****

We are all driven to do more and to get things done. Here's the thing, you may not have realized it, but a beard can help you achieve more and do more,...a beard can help you dominate!

****

Studies have shown that a beard transmits you are masculine, dominant, and non-conforming, among other things. 

****

Therefore, the choice of what beard style to wear is very important. Your beard is not only telling the world your outlook on life, it is breaking down barriers and shaping perceptions. It tells people who you are and what you can do. People subconsciously realize that if you have the patience and determination to grow a beard, then you have the patience and determination to get the job done. 

****

As far as which beard style allows you to project these perceptions and dominate life, well...that depends on a few things...

# What Beard Style is for Me?

****

There are many ways to answer that question,... based on your face shape, what will get you promoted at work, what influences the women in your life (or you wish were in your life), how your friends see you, or simply, what you want. 

****

A beard shows people what's in your pants without you having to unzip all the time. Since this is of the utmost importance, the major decision points will be covered to give you the most information for you to choose the best beard style. 

So let's get to it...

# What You Should Consider When Choosing a Beard Style?

****

## Choose Based on Your Face Shape

****
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c4e0b35ac52d0273ed2f95c74a2a4b41c9a4dacf.jpg)

One of the most popular approaches to choosing a beard style is starting with your face shape. Essentially, you are using your facial hair to help balance your face. 

****

There are numerous opinions regarding how many different face shapes there are. We will try to distill it down to a few. Furthermore, there are many opinions on what is the optimal face shape or shapes to have. 

****

Through my research, study, and opinion, I have found that there are two optimal face shapes, oval,... ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/87003b15dd8f826fc55710dd2e39932d97d7fc6a.jpg)

and square. 

****
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1f7e1b54fd1a82f060a1914d34d0fe8d5fa6c744.jpg)

If you have these face shapes, you can pretty much wear whatever beard you want and can grow. I just show a few types for each shape. 

****

The goal in choosing a beard style based on face shape is to achieve balance. You are trying to balance your face to either an oval or a square shape. So, if your face is long and narrow, don't grow a long goatee. If it short and round, don't grow large bushy sideburns. 

****
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2fc5d1db9ca2d4c20cca66b8c50cd580151ba681.jpg)

Remember the point is to achieve balance. You want to make your face seem more long, short, narrow, wide, or combination of those to achieve a square or an oval face. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9cbe8fef0a1c9ee2b8220c0742bee586b8dfe1c9.jpg)

First, look at the ones without beards to help you decide what your face shape is.

****

Chances are you are not one pure type, but a combination of types; therefore you have to use your head (I couldn't resist), i.e. your best judgement as your guide.

****

You will see how each beard style gives balance to that particular face shape.

****
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b912e05ba1ce6f818a7336b988a0798c6e81260d.jpg)

A trick to use is look into a mirror and draw the outline of your head, minus hair of course, and compare it to the drawings. You can use a dry erase marker. 

****
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4ef66f91fa2f6f11eb52eecadeca3038ce4191a1.jpg)

Remember you are probably not one pure type, so look for the different attributes of your face. 

****

Of course we can't cover all of the beard styles known to man, but we can cover the most common and popular.

## Choose Based on Your Hair Growth

Does your hair grow in patchy?

****

Your beard growth is influenced by a number of factors such as your testosterone levels, nutrition intake, how cold or hot it is, or some medical conditions. 

****

This is an article unto itself, as I am sure there are many of you out there that are not happy with their patchy growth. 

****

What I will cover is how to work around your current level of hairiness. I say current because many beards improve the older you get.

****

So, if you are having difficulty making your cheek hair meet your chin hair, consider sideburns with a goatee or circle beard. The key is to make it look intentional. Use various styles to work around your weak spots.

****

Many men, not all mind you, experience more vigorous growth on their chin than on their cheeks. If this is the case, use your strengths and go with a Van Dyke, goatee, or soul patch.

****
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7a8c647ccb76137ac43d264b8fd2004ae1a3cf48.jpg)

Another option is to keep your beard at a stubble length or very short. You kind of have that rough look and this may work for your work environment and social life. 

****

The key is to minimize your beard weak points and maximize your beard strong points.

Think about your strong and weak points and adapt until you get older, treat the underlying issue, or... get beard implants. 

****

As you emphasize your strengths and minimize your weaknesses, don't worry about following any predetermined beard style. It is ok to make up your own style! Remember, the key to this whole facial hair thing is balance. Of course, it doesn't hurt to throw in some style and attitude when you can! 

****

Look at the styles above and pick some style features that will suit your current hair growth and your face shape. 

****

Just because you have some patchy spots does not mean that you can't sport some great beardage. 

****

Does your hair grow in thick?

****

In this case, you can pretty much grow in anything you want. If you have full coverage with excellent density, you are golden. The thing to keep in mind now is your face shape. 

****

You are in a great position my friend. Use your power wisely. 

****

Choose Based on What You Want to Hide or minimize

****

You may want to hide or minimize many things. Some may want to hide a body part, i.e. a big nose, or what you consider to be a defect in your skin, i.e. pockmarks from acne. 

****

When you're trying to "hide," "camouflage," or "minimize" a body part. There are just a few rules of thumb.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d7b39b0b-68bf-471f-94e2-1db442773f4b.jpg)

For a BIG body part, go BIG with your facial hair next to that body part. For example, for a big nose, go with a big mustache. This can even work for your whole face. If you have a large face, think big beard. Grow a large beard and you will be surprised at how it minimizes your exposed face.

For a small body part, go small with your facial hair next to that body part. So, if you have a small nose, go with a trimmed down, small mustache. If you go big, your mustache will consume your nose. Keep things proportional.

Exception: The biggest exception is when you are dealing with a small or a weak chin. In this case, go big or long on your beard. You want to elongate your face to compensate for your weak chin. This will give you a more manly and strong chin which will convey a strong masculine jaw line.

****

Think of it as not really hiding or minimizing some of your features as highlighting your manly ability to grow a beard!

****

## Choose Based on Womanly Considerations 

****

_"Kissing a man with a beard is a lot like going to a picnic. You don't mind going through a little bush to get there!"_

_****_

Minnie Pearl

****

There are two approaches here: 1) Take into consideration what your woman likes and dislikes; or 2) Do what you want. This section talks about taking into considerations her wants/desires, but even if you chose the second option and do whatever you damn well please, there are some helpful hints in here for you.

****

What Does She Like?

****

Does she like a full beard, all natural and barely combed? Does she like a neatly trimmed boxed beard, that has well defined lines on your cheeks and neck? Does she like sideburns only or just a goatee? Does she picture you in a certain style or projecting a certain attitude? 

****

Ask her these questions and walk her through the various beard styles in this article. 

****

**The Kissing**

****

One of the most crucial issues is hair around your mouth. Where many start to freak out a bit is when your mustache starts hanging over your top lip and starts becoming an active participant every time you two kiss. Be sure to explore her feelings on your potential mustache.

****

Now this could be a good or a bad thing depending on the attitude and likes/dislikes of your woman. She may begin to feel smothered by a large mustache, but the most common criticism I hear is that it kind of creeps them out having hair tickle them when they are kissing you. It may take time to get accustomed to this extra or new stimulus. 

****

However, many women really like it and see it as an indicator of your manhood and they want all they can get. Kissing you and feeling your mustache and beard really gets them excited! If your lady feels this way, you are very blessed, my friend. 

****

So, if she likes the full effect, then rock on a full overhanging the lip 'stache and live well. If not, there is still hope.

****

Sometimes, there is just no getting around the issue some women have with feeling facial hair anywhere around the lips. They just don't like it. Maybe after a "getting used to it slowly" phase, they may begin to tolerate it and then like it, but for now you may have to take a different approach. 

****

There are some options, as there are some facial hair styles that do not include a mustache. For instance, you can try a goatee or a soul patch if you want to try something just on the chin. If you want to go larger, a dutch beard may work. All of these options work if she is not bothered by hair below your lips. 

****
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/770d2dfe3bf08b180a0ac1ea0618e284a6c5538a.jpg)

If she is completely freaked out by hair anywhere near your mouth, there are a few other options you can try. For instance, how about just having mutton chops or the hulihee. These may not be your facial hair of choice, but at least they are something. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7561e88c3d3801266948d6b2a2cdd08a3af158a4.jpg)

If you are looking for something more beard like, that wraps around yet still keeps hair away from your mouth, you can go for a chin curtain beard. You can also go with something you don't often see nowadays: a neckbeard. Lastly, if you really want to be a little weird, and very minimal, you can don the El Insecto. That certainly does not have any hair near your pie hole. 

****
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2a3693cc816e7f90831e5c3e1b5720f1d81f2e36.jpg)

Another thing you can do is play around with a few websites that picture you with various styles of facial hair. While these sites are ok, they really cannot show you what you would look like when your hair grows out. These sites are assuming a lot when they show you with a beard and it never really matches reality. 

****

There is a good chance your beard may be different colors than your head hair. In fact, it is not uncommon that your beard would sport at least three colors. 

****

Also, you more than likely will not have uniform growth. Both in hair coverage and hair growth rate. So,...that's why these websites that show you with various styles superimposed on your face are ok, but not really meaningful in the end. 

****

Speaking of growth rate, I have noticed that the gray hairs in your beard grow faster than the non-gray portions. So look out for this if you have patches of gray coming into your mug rug. Of course, this adds to the appearance of being older and of higher social status! Wear your gray well, my friend! 

****

**The Sex**

****

Ok, so let's talk about something that you need to talk about with your woman,...how having a beard enhances, degrades, or does nothing for, the sex. 

****

Before we get to the most sensitive part of her body and what may concern her most, let's talk about how a beard comes into play when you are playing...

****

A beard's effect on activities when you are playing hide the sausage can be good or bad depending primarily on two things: 1) The attitude of those involved, and: 2) The length of the beard. 

****

If your woman has a positive attitude about beards, and especially you having a beard, the experience can be a great one. 

****

If your beard is long enough, in certain positions, your beard will probably drape over her body and it is a great stimulant for many women. I have to say, also, this does something for the man as well. Just something about it,...just sayin'. It is a great thing for your beard to be used in sexual play. And for it to be appreciated by your woman just like any other part of your body is wonderful. 

****

Many women also like to run their fingers through their man"s beard during activities. All I am saying is stroking the beard leads to other things...like more stroking....and stuff.

****

Now, let's talk about brushing her bush with your bush brush.

****

So here is where you have the advantage over stubble. They may be more preferable in the looks department, but you, my friend, will be softer on all of the parts between and including her thighs. So, it may come as no surprise to you that the number one complaint from women is that the man's beard, no matter if it is stubble or a full beard, is rough or is perceived as rough, on their female parts. 

**[][0]**

The more full and the softer your beard is, the easier it will be on your woman's sensitive body parts. You can accomplish this a few ways: 1) Grow your beard hair out longer and thus make it softer; and/or 2) Use beard oil. 

****

Growing your beard out longer and using things which soften your beard should make things more pleasant for your woman. Of course your beard has to be long enough to be softened by the oil. The minimal length is going to be dependent upon your genetics, hair diameter, curliness, thickness, etc. This is something you will just have to figure out. As you grow out your beard, pay attention to the length at which she begins to complain and then to not complain about your beard poking her or rubbing her raw. 

****

Ok, so we spoke a bit about friction, but here is another major consideration when eating with a beard and that is mustache length. 

****

How would that matter? Well, let me tell you, when you are trying to locate her button o' joy and things are a bit wild, no amount of mustache wax is going to help you keep your upper lip hairs in place. They will get in the way. 

****

You, my friend, may have lots of hair that needs to be parted. You will have to move it to the side to reach your goal. Once you get nestled in, you will be ok, but you have to get there. So, move your big man-stache to the sides. The big issue is getting past her hair and your hair to the joy button. The foliage is thick, but well worth the effort once you get to your goal. Once you are settled and lock on, your beard and stache will give her a very soft and comfortable ride...kind of like a saddle blanket.

****

Take your time and be patient. You grew your beard with patience and this is how you must approach many things in life including performing certain duties for your mate. 

****

## Choose Based on Your Boss or Work Environment

****

**What is tolerated?**

****

So, look around you. What facial hair style are most men wearing where you work? Are men keeping a clean shaven look? Are they sporting stubble, but only on casual Fridays? A good look around will give you an idea of what the most tolerated styles are. 

****

This may also give you an idea as to the most common styles and if something is trending at your workplace. 

****

**What is rewarded?**

****

What are your CEO, the big executives, and your supervisor wearing (assuming they are guys)? This may give you an idea as to what facial hair styles will be rewarded. I am not sure if mimicking their facial hair style will give you a leg up on any promotions or good assignments, but it may not hurt. 

****

What if you only see a lot of clean shaven men in upper management? Well, this does not mean that your dreams of having a beard are gone. This just means that they are a conservative lot and you may want to take a conservative approach to your facial hair. 

****

With beards on the rise for the last few years, those in upper management have begun to see a lot of their workforce sporting a beard or mustache. They may not like it, but I am sure they have noticed. 

****

This works to your advantage, in that they already know things are changing and so they may tolerate a bit of change in the facial hair department. 

What they are most likely concerned with is a professional image. 

****

So, instead of a large burly Garibaldi, you may want to just go with a short boxed beard or at the most adventurous level, a full beard, but very neatly trimmed. 

****
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/15e7c2728804db15334ff77a00699a72a1c60a27.jpg)

If you are going for the short boxed beard, you must make it tight. What I mean by that is your lines, both on your cheeks and on your neck, should be well defined. Make sure you shave the neck and don't let your neckline go too far down your neck. The cheek lines should go, at most, halfway up your cheeks and meet your mustache naturally and evenly. Trim the hairs over your lip and beneath your nose. It is best to keep them the same length as the rest of your beard hair. Keep all of your beard hair short and even. 

****

Perhaps the most adventurous you can be is to wear a full beard in a conservative environment. I would suggest not going too long for your first attempt. The full beard is a bit different from the short boxed beard. The hair is longer, of course, and you can go higher up on your cheeks and lower on your neck. You also don't have to be as picky in creating well defined lines. I think what you are trying to do with a full beard in the work environment is straddle that line of being the rugged, virile, confident man without looking like you're lazy. 

****

I certainly like the full beard style. You can make it look professional by using oils and waxes along with certain grooming techniques, if you want a smoother look when you are at work. On the weekends you can let it go a bit or style it in a way that make you look a bit more rugged. Even if you keep it groomed well all the time, a full beard just looks more rugged in a longsleeved t-shirt or other casual attire. 

****

If you want to go with something that is not a full beard, there are options. A circle beard, sometimes called a door-knocker, is a common and accepted style. This has been a popular style since the '90s, so it is fair to say those at the top of your corporate food chain will accept it. You may want to keep the hair trimmed on the shorter side and keep the hair from extending and overhanging your upper lip. 

****
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4abfb653a1f832407532dd59d959616624cdbe8c.jpg)

So, take a look around you and notice what the trends are. See who was recently promoted and what they are sporting. 

****

As you look at the facial hair climate at your workplace, always keep in mind that certain jobs just won't allow you to have a beard. This has been the case in most of the military and the fire service, to name a couple. 

****

Also, please keep in mind any safety issues that you may have at your workplace. If there is a chance of your beard getting tangled in a piece of machinery, you may want to rethink your decision, at least for a long beard style. 

****

On the other hand, you can tie up and secure your long beard in such way as to prevent it from being caught by large moving parts. 

****

## Choose Based on Your Personality

****

You want to show people who you are.

****

Ok, you have decided to go all out and show everyone who you are and the beard is one of the ways you want to do it. 

****

There is something to be said for going this route. 

****

You, then, will choose your style based on what you are trying to convey. The field is wide open here. 

****

You may want to search images and see which ones resonate with you and display the attitude that suits you. 

****

A quick way may be to just put the word "beard" with whatever group of folks you most identify with. For example, if you are into tactical firearms, knives, and equipment, you may want to search for "tactical beard" in Google images. 

****

When you do this, you will get not only some examples of beards you may want to emulate, but some tips on how to pull off this particular style. Have fun and enjoy looking at all of the options, just remember you are looking for the right style for you. 

****

## You want what you want

****

This will be by far the shortest section in this article. 

****

Pick what you want. You're welcome. Have fun. Beard up!

****

## Choose Based on Your Style

****

What statement do you want to make

****

This is a little different than the section above in that you may or may not be trying to convey your true personality. You may want to project a certain image. 

****

For instance, you may want to convey a rugged professional look in which you would adopt a trimmed full beard style that you would keep well groomed when you are conducting business. 

****

You may want to portray an image of "Screw You" with a large full beard and visible tattoos. 

****
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c9ba54ed-1e79-426b-9fee-09ca65ad5303.jpg)

It's your choice as to what statement you want to make. Just make sure you choose a style that conveys what you want. 

****

You may be wondering, is there a specific meaning to the various beard styles? Well, not really. I mean there are a few generalizations you can draw, but for the most part, no there are no assigned meanings. 

****

I think it is a combination of your beard, your head hair, your tattoos, your piercings, your clothes, and your personality, all of you, which admittedly only comes through once someone begins to talk with you. 

****

That being said, beards and beard wearers have been shown to inspire certain perceptions. In large societies, people look for clues to make a judgement about who you are and what you can do. The reason why is that we just don't have the time to talk to and get to know everyone in our community. 

****

Instead of getting to know someone, we make assumptions and judgement calls based on what we see. We are making judgements on your fitness (your ability to win and reproduce) when we look at you. When we see your beard, we see your testosterone. We see that you are more aggressive and dominant that others without facial hair. 

****

## What Your Beard Says About You

****

Having a beard says a lot about you and people will make certain assumptions about you, just like they are doing now when they look at you. 

****

Essentially, studies have shown that whatever type of facial hair is rare, i.e. in the minority, that style is perceived as the "most" attractive. Of course this will change over time and between the different social groups you run with. 

**[][1]**

There are other assumptions people make about a man with a beard. 

One study found they ascribed to bearded men a higher social status and age than their clean-shaven counterparts. 

**[][2]**

The same paper concluded that beards are perceived to augment the effectiveness of aggressive facial displays. 

****

So, listen. Your choice to grow a beard should not be taken lightly. 

Those who choose to grow beards, in my experience, are unapologetically male.

They are men who choose to wear the symbol of testosterone on their face and let the world know who they are. Again they dominate. Your choice to grow a beard shows your capacity to dominate! 

****

# What Sayings Go With My New Facial Hair?

## What to Say When You Are With Your Non-Bearded Buddies

****

So, you are out drinking beer with your friends and invariably, one of them is going to look at your face, in its scraggly early-growth stage, and proceed to insult you. They will do so in a friendly, male dominating, making-fun-of-your-face kind of way. What do you do in this type of situation?

****

Well, here are a few one-liners you can memorize to defend your beard and at the same time put down their womanly face. These also work as texts.

****

* I understand your jealousy, especially when you see testosterone escaping from my face.
* I call it my Bush Brush. You obviously do not need one.
* I see that my facial hair intimidates you. Let me assure you that being clean-shaven compliments the feminine look you're going for. 
* Look, I think it is great you guys don't have a beard. People will just assume I am in charge.
* I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the greatness of my beard.
* I know seeing my excess testosterone may make you upset in your time of excess estrogen. 
* I can see my excess testosterone is upsetting you. I don't like upsetting women,...sorry about that. 
* I understand the weight of manhood is too much for you.
* I understand shaving says a lot about you,...like, you're not a man. 
* Why are you getting so mad? I am not saying you are less of a man for being clean shaven. I'm just saying you look like less of a man. 
* It really is the easiest way to say "I'm in charge."
* It's just my way to give the world a middle finger with my face. 
* It really is the easiest way to say "I am in charge" while at the same time giving the world the middle finger with my face.

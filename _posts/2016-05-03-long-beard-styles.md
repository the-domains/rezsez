# Long Beard Styles

****

It takes a certain amount of balls to choose a long beard style. You need planning and decision making skills to determine what your end goal will be in the facial hair department. Patience is also required, as it takes a minimum of a few months to get any length on your magnificent face armor. Lastly, it takes adaptive management to cope with the issues that will present themselves over the course of your beard growing out, such as patchiness, uneven growth, or the boss making a negative comment. 

****

It takes a man that can dominate any situation and no beard style says, "Hey, look at my testosterone" better than a long beard style. It clearly shows what you have in your pants even if your beard is so long it covers your wedding tackle. 

****

In short it takes a certain kind of man to even begin this journey and a determined one to work through the issues until he reaches his goal. It takes a man that can plan, stick to his goal, adapt and overcome the obstacles. It takes a certain kind of man to never apologize for his beard.

## So What Is a Long Beard Style?

****

If you use an electric trimmer to maintain your beard length, then you do not have a long beard style. If you can smooth your beard with a towel and people think you look fine, you do not have long beard. 

****

If you have to use a comb or a brush to make your face blanket presentable, then you, sir, have a long beard style. The styles that you must groom, the styles that you must put a bit of effort towards,...these are the ones that we will focus on in this article. 

****

While these do take effort to maintain, they are the very beards most everyone will stop and compliment you on. These are the beards that show the extent of your testosterone!

****

Establishing and maintaining a long beard style is a bit different than establishing and maintaining a short beard style. 

****

Many think that long beard styles are the easiest to pull off because they think there is no maintenance involved with those particular styles. That is simply not true. 

****

Of course the level of maintenance depends on the level of neatness you would like to achieve in your man rug. You may grow a large tangled mass of beard on your face, but that is not usually what you want. 

****

## What Are The Different Long Beard Styles?
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4b0e229362fe039b41a9cad2ff524f37cf9a27cc.png)

So, if you have not figured it out yet, there is no common definition of what constitutes a long beard style. For example, a goatee can fall into either the short or long beard style categories. It just depends on the length. That being said, here are some styles that many tend to grow into a long style. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1eb2193a9f7eb2044dcd64b7b0cfe6852dc0dda2.png)

The styles shown on their optimal face shape. When I say optimal, I mean that the beard style provides a bit of balance to the face. So, when you look at these styles, keep in mind the faces are not all the same shape.

****

Of course the examples do not depict the varying lengths that each style could have. You can decide your ultimate length when you plan your beard. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4a450998c4ba5ac38875d2ead2ece1cbbe34c5f9.png)

## How Do I Plan For My Long Beard Style?

****

So, how in the world do you make a plan for a long beard style when you do not know what your beard will look like when it gets long?

****

Well, a good place to start is the end. Begin with the end in mind and try to get an idea as to what you want your beard to look like. 

****

You can research Google images to search for beards that match your lifestyle and your face shape. For example, if you are considering professional beards, type that into Google Images and see what you come up with. Discuss these with your better half. You can find some tips on choosing a look here.

****

Now that you have at least a concept of your "goal beard", you need to determine which parts of your beard you are going to trim (if needed) and which parts you will let grow. This will be based on the style you are shooting for. If you look at the different styles, you will notice some have different lengths of hair on the various parts of the face. Some may be shorter on the cheeks and longer on the chin. Make sure you are aware of these differences because they determine where you will start trimming. 

****

Also, decide if you want a natural look or a more smooth groomed look. The natural look, while easier to maintain, will have many "fly away" hairs that will poke out of the surface of your beard and the edges of your beard may not be as straight due to uneven growth. 

****

This may not be the look you are going for because they do make you look at bit rougher and unkempt. Of course many guys and girls like the rugged, natural look. 

****

If you are going for a more groomed look, because that is what you like or because you want to portray a more professional image, then you would want to plan to do a bit of trimming. 

****

The main areas you may need to trim based on your chosen beard style:
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5236d056-0c60-4638-b87b-eddcb4711e92.png)

Surface or Front - only necessary if you want a smooth, well groomed look. Check your profile to see any stray hairs that spring up toward the front of the beard and trim them flush. NOTE: This only requires trimming a very little bit of the hair; don't go crazy. (Another option is to use a product that smooths the fly-aways down and holds them in place, like a moustache/beard wax.)
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/82b5c920-49fa-4db6-8429-4375a4fad12b.png)

Mustache - trim or style both the top edge, bottom edge or both.

Bottom edges - this is the bottom line of the beard from ear to chin to ear.

Top edge - shape the cheekline.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7229050c-c6e4-4a8f-aef5-8f35801a93ec.png)

Underbelly or the floor/base of the beard - the hair that grows under your jaw including the throat area.

Surface trimming works for any style except the all natural look. How and whether to use the other techniques will be determined by which style you are creating.

****

The timing of the trimming:

****

1. Let it grow 
2. Trim as it grows or trim at the end, i.e. the length you want 
3. Shape it up
  1. For a long beard style, go for a more natural less defined cheek line
  2. More natural neckline as well
  3. Two options
    1. Let it grow down your neck and shape as you go
    2. Shape it up to establish a short boxed beard neckline and then slowly move the neckline down over the next few months

## Adaptive Management

So what happens when you are growing your beard and it is not turning out like you had hoped it would. This is where you need to really take a hard look at what your beard is doing and how it is growing. 

****

Is it patchy in places? Is it longer in some places than others? Is it curly all over? Or is it curly only in certain places? 

****

What is your beard doing as compared to your beard style goal? Where does it meet your goal and where does it fall short? 

****

This is where having a goal pays off. With a plan and goal, you can calmly analyze the situation. 

****

Without a plan and goal, after weeks of growing this thing on your face, you will be looking at it in all it's scraggly glory and saying to yourself, "Now what?" You may even think to yourself, "Man, I really screwed this up. I look awful." 

****

If you do have a plan and goal in place, you can see this stage of your growth as just that: a stage, not a big mess. 

****

Think very carefully about how to place your beard on the right trajectory to your beard goal. Always make small and I mean SMALL adjustments. 

****

If you are going to trim as your beard grows, make sure your changes are in proportion to your current beard. You may now have a small beard and that means small changes make a big difference. 

****

I am sure you know how hair works by this point in your life. If you cut it too short, it takes time to get it back to where you started. 

****

If you do screw up, don't freak out. It is hair and it will grow back. 

Pogonotrohy takes patience and it never stops. 

You are never done because your beard is always growing. 

****

This is great because if you are a pogonotroph, there is ample opportunity to get it right, so don't worry. 

## Living With Your Beard

## Watch The Bottom Of Your Beard

Depending on how long your beard is, you may run into some issues when you do certain activities, like getting dressed. 

****

Long beards have been known to get caught in jacket zippers. Just think about where this part of your body is and what it might get caught up in. You have been doing this your entire life for another long part of your body that may get caught up in a zipper. 

****

You are going to have to get used to having a really long chin!

## How To Eat and Drink With A Long Mustache

Having a long beard style sometimes means having a longer mustache. If you have a long mustache, you will run into issues. Even if you keep it waxed up, it will get in the way when you are eating and drinking and ...other stuff. 

****

Maybe I am a bit slow, but I did not expect this when I grew my beard and mustache out.

****

You will need to take a different approach when you are eating certain foods when you have a long 'stache. These foods are, but are not limited to:

****

* Anything you bite into that exceeds the corners of your mouth or can push your mustache hairs into your mouth like burgers and sandwiches.
* Anything which has a lot of sauce like spaghetti or chicken wings.
* Anything which has a tendency to fall or drip out of your spoon like soup.
* Anything you drink. 
* Anything You Bite Into

You will be in pain if you bite into something and are not careful. The food will carry your mustache between your teeth and they will rip the hairs out of your upper lip. Trust me, this is not pleasant. I speak from experience. 

****

So take the time, no matter how awkward, to stop in mid-bite and remove your mustache from your mouth with your fingers. Otherwise you may end up crying like a little girl. Let me tell you, tearing up over biting into a burger is not very manly. Although, I guess you could tell everyone it is the best burger you've ever eaten and you were overcome by emotion. 

****

### Anything That Has Sauce On It or Drips

Beards and mustaches collect sauces and soups. This also happens even if you have a relativity short beard. Things like spaghetti and chicken wings can get quite messy. 

****

There are two approaches here: 

****

1. Use a small spoon or a knife and fork to reduce the size of you food so it will not make contact with your beard or exceed the corners of your mouth. While this will work with most food, it really won't work for traditional wings. However, if your goal is to look like a long bearded badass who eats his wings with a knife and fork like a prissy little girl, I guess it will work.
2. Just eat it. Go for it, be messy, and wipe up at the end. That is what I do when I am eating wings. If anyone tries to give you a hard time, just make a few comments regarding how you think it is great they can keep their womanly face clean and not smear their makeup. 

****

Your beard may get messy no matter what you do when you eat. That's ok. Clean up and comb out.

****

### Drinking

****

Also, your mustache may be an active player when you take a drink from a cup or glass. Why? Well, your lip hair will come into contact with the liquid in your cup or glass and get soaked with your drink and/or get caught on the lip of your vessel and then flick liquid onto the bottom of your beard or on your shirt. 

****

There are some things you can do to minimize the affects of your 'stache having its way with your beverage.

****

First you can change the angle in which you drink. When you take a drink, lean your head back more than your normally would and pour the drink into your mouth. When taking the glass away from your mouth, let your bottom lip catch any remaining liquid off the edge of your glass. 

****

That way you limit mustache play in your beverage. You tilt and pour to keep your mustache out of the way. This works in most situations, but there are other ways. I use this method especially when out with the guys drinking beer. 

****

You can also use what is called a mustache cup. This is a special cup with a unique lip on one side of the cup that covers your mustache and therefore keeps it separated from your drink. You can get a mustache mug for drinking coffee and what not and get a mustache stein for your beer drinking sessions. 

****

A mustache insert is a device that you can use with a variety of cups and glasses. This is a small, but handy, device that you can use to keep the top of your beard high and dry. 

****

You can also use a straw. It is simple, but also not really manly in some situations. You can use restaurant straws or use your own. These can be ones you make yourself or durable ones you buy and carry around for your drinking needs. Granted, you do not look as cool being all manly and sipping your beer through a straw. That is why this method should be used for normal day to day beverages such as tea, water, or any non alcoholic beverages. 

****

If you are a wine drinker, they make a wine glass with a built in glass straw coming out the bottom. This allows you to not make a mess, not tilt and pour, and look a bit unique as you sip your wine. 

****

Here is something else you may not have considered. So, I am getting ready for bed one night and start flossing. My beard and mustache are going wild and all over the place. Before you know it, mustache hairs got caught in my floss and I flossed my mustache in between my teeth. I take out my floss and stare at the mirror with my mustache going into my mouth and my lip indented from the strain. It was quite sucky getting it out. The sad thing is, I have done this more than once. Pathetic. I have no solution...yet.

## Long Bearding = Badass

The bottom line: if you choose to grow a long beard style, you are a badass. Long Bearding takes goal setting, planning skills, and decision making. It takes patience and the realization that pogonotrophy is a lifestyle and long term choice rather than a spontaneous decision. It never stops because you never stop. It is born from your true identity,...that of a true man. 

****

People compliment me on my beard every week, the average is 2-3 times every week. They like what they see, but I believe that they do not really know why. I think one of the reasons they like it is not only the manly appearance I project, but the characteristics of manhood I model. They subconsciously recognize my dedication, patience, and perseverance,...and they like it.
